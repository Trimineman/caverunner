# caverunner
Final project for AP Computer Science!
The game starts off in a randomly generated cave. You must run from one side of the cave to another, but beware: the cave will close and open, and you need to take shelter in the gaps when the cave closes! Once you reach the end of the screen, another length of cave will generate before you, and the game will speed up. Good luck!
